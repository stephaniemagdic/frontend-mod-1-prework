## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?


Because I have worked in education for the past several years, I am familiar with growth mindset. I actually presented on it when Carol Dweck's research came out! However, just because I know the research doesn't mean that I have the mindset, so I love being reminded of the research. The idea that having a growth mindset can help you to seek out new challenges resonates with me and reminds me that although there might be times when I am feeling like I can't learn or do something (ie when I come across a challenging coding problem), I remember that deciding to learn to enroll in Turing and learn to code means I do actually work within a growth mindset. I *do" believe I CAN learn and be successful with hard work. I do believe success isn't a smooth process. Another point that resonated with me was when Carmen P. reminded the audience that we shouldn't compare ourselves to others, and instead we should often look at the incremental _progress_ we are making. I think that is a *great* point and will be a helpful step in keeping a healthy growth mindset throughout Turing.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?


Currently, I demonstrate a growth mindset by continuing to work at things that I do not understand at first. I always choose to work hard and keep at it, and I can always see growth. Coding specifically is different in that it is also a skill where I do have some wrapped up limiting beliefs so I will have to remember the growth mindset and remember that coding is just another skill. Just like other things in my life I have learned, learning to code is no different: *it is a learning process*. Therefore this answers the question, how do I "not" have a growth mindset. Sometimes I do fall into the trap of believing certain skills are natural to some people and are "meant" for and easier learned by others. I plan to unpack my mindset book and remind myself of some of the research to help me to work through some of these sticky points.

3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.


I would imagine Netflix uses arrays in a variety of ways, many times with the same elements moving in and out of one array and then in and out of another. For example, at first you might see it in an array named "newToNetflix", and later you might see it in "tvShowsForYou", and later still you might see it in another category when you search for a movie with a similar title (therefore, it is probably sorted into another array). I think that an application like Netflix uses arrays very often and it comes in handy when categorizing and grouping data to display to the user based on multiple searches and display criteria.

4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.


An array is a special variable that allows you to store multiple pieces of data in a single variable that are all related to each other in some way. You can call the data at indexes and you can add data to the group or take away pieces of data from that group.


5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?


A loop allows you to perform the same action a specified number of times or while a certain condition is true. We would use a loop in an array when we want to iterate over all pieces of data (all indexes) in the array and so we might use a for/loop for that. We wouldn't use a loop with an array if we didn't want to use each piece of data in the array/ were only wanting to pull data at a specific index.

6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?


A loop is when we do the same thing many many times over and over really fast. For example we have to take care of our pets every day, and we have 4 different pets, but they all need the same things. They all need food; they all need to be played with; they all need water; and they all need their spaces cleaned so it's nice for them to live there. We have to do the same 4 things many many times-- 4 times exactly for each of our 4 pets! Remember for each pet, we have to feed them, play with them, give them water, and clean up after them. So when we do our chore we are not done until we do all 4 chores for every pet, and when we are done, then we can move on to doing something different because we will be done with our chore.

7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?


NA
