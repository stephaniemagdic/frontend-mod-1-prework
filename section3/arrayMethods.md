##Array Methods Explained

1. pop


The `pop()` method will take the *last* element in the arrow, remove it from the array, and return that element. Therefore you can use `pop()` to save and callback what you pulled, by creating a new variable and assigning that method to the variable if you wanted. The `pop()` method will change the lengths of your array. The next time you call the array it will be updated with the last element in the array removed.

2. push


The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array. Whatever you put in the parentheses will be added to the end of the array, whether it is a number, string or other.


(Note: When the method is assigned to a variable, it can also track or give you the total of the array. But it looks like many of these methods do this same thing when you assign them to a variable (ie that variable can track that count).)

3. shift


The `shift()` method is very similar to the `pop()` method. It does the same thing as `pop()` but it takes from the front of the array. It also returns the removed element and will shorten the length of the array.


4. unshift


The `unshift()` method allows you to add elements to the front of the array by passing them as arguments (which can include one or more elements inside the parentheses). Because of this you really need to pass arguments or you will not be adding anything to the array (unlike `shift()` where you don't need to put anything in the ().)
