## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?


It felt really good. Actually, its funny because the step of having to estimate the time it will take you to complete a task and STICKING to a plan (while taking breaks) I feel is very necessary to productivity especially when learning a challenging new skill. I think we can far underestimate the amount of time tasks take us and I also think that we can tend to procrastinate or get distracted when we are not intentional about those 25 minute FOCUSED time (no cell phone, _nothing_ distracting).

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?


I think I found myself distracted... *by code!* By wanting to go down rabbit holes or learning more about what I was learning about, because you can spend hours on a concept. I am glad I learned this while working through pre-work and *NOT* while I was at Turing in a difficult fast-paced mod. I think there will always (even as a senior engineer) be so much to learn and so staying focused on goals (and maybe doing some smart goal setting regularly) is going to be a really crucial step to staying focused. As I mentioned previously, I think I underestimate the amount of time a task will take me.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?


An object is a key-value pair. It links an attribute with a value (that makes each instance unique) and that key-value pair with the object. While an object is a group (like arrays) it is also able to link information, keys and values, to one another.


4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: ARRAY
  * List of states and their capitals: OBJECT
  * List of things to pack for vacation: ARRAY (unless you want to categorize the items like toiletries, clothes, planeActivities)
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: ARRAY
  * List of student names and their cohort: OBJECT
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: OBJECT
  * All my favorite restaurants: ARRAY

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?


On Zillow, each house I would imagine would be an object. There may even be objects inside each object instance of a house. Each instance would have keys on the results page like listed price, number of beds, if it is sold or pending (status), and the address, and then when you click on the house more data about the object may be displayed on the page, like many more home and neighborhood details. Attached to those keys would be each listings specific data. (IE each house would have its own price value that would match to the price key.)

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?


NA. Thank you!
