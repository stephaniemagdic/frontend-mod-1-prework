// Declare two variables - heroName AND specialAbility - set to strings

```
var heroName = "Superman";
var specialAbility = "flight";
```

// Declare two variables - greeting AND catchphrase
//   greeting should be assigned to a string that uses concatenation to include the heroName
//   catchphrase should be assigned to a string that uses interpolation to include the specialAbility

```
var greeting = "Hello! " + "It is " + heroName + " to the rescue.";
var catchphrase = `This looks like a job for ${heroName}. He has the special ability of ${specialAbility}! Up, up and away!`;
```

// Declare two variables - power AND energy - set to integers

```
var power = 100
var energy = 100
```
// Declare two variables - fullPower AND fullEnergy
//   fullPower should multiply your current power by 500
//   fullEnergy should add 150 to your current energy
```

```

// Declare two variables - isHuman and identityConcealed - assigned to booleans

```
var isHuman = false;
var identityConcelead = true;
```

// Declare two variables - archEnemies AND sidekicks
//   archEnemies should be an array of at least 3 different enemy strings
//   sidekicks should be an array of at least 3 different sidekick strings


```
var archEnemies = ["Darkseid", "Lex Luthor", "Bizarro"];

```

// Print the first sidekick to your console
```

```

// Write some code to add a new archEnemy to the archEnemies array
```

// Print the archEnemies array to console to ensure you added a new archEnemy
```

// Remove the first sidekick from the sidekicks array
```

// Print the sidekicks array to console to ensure you added a new sidekick
```

// Create a function called assessSituation that takes three arguments - dangerLevel, saveTheDay, badExcuse
//   - dangerLevel should be an integer
//   - saveTheDay should be a string a hero would say once they save the day 
//   - badExcuse should be a string a hero would say if they are too afraid of the dangerLevel

// Your function should include an if/else statement that meets the following criteria
//   - Danger levels that are above 50 are too scary for your hero. Any danger level that is above 50 should result in printing the badExcuse to the console
//   - Anything dangerLevel that is between 10 and 50 should result in printing the saveTheDay string to the console
//   - If the dangerLevel is below 10, it means it is not worth your time and should result in printing the string "Meh. Hard pass." to the console.

```
var dangerLevel = 0;
var saveTheDay = "Never Fear. I am here to save the day!";
var badExcuse = "I am so sorry. My ðŸš¨ alarm didn't go off.";

//Test Cases
var announcement = 'Never fear, the Courageous Curly Bracket is here!';
var excuse = 'I think I forgot to lock up my 1992 Toyota Coralla. Be right back.';
//assessSituation(99, announcement, excuse) > Should print - 'I think I forgot to lock up my 1992 Toyota Coralla. Be right back.'
//assessSituation(21, announcement, excuse) > should print - 'Never fear, the Courageous Curly Bracket is here!'
//assessSituation(3, announcement, excuse) > should print - "Meh. Hard pass."


// Declare a new variable - scaryMonster - assigned to an Object with the following key/values
//   - name (string)
//   - smell (string)

// Create a new class called SuperHero

```
// - Create the following class methods
//   - sayName, should print the hero's name to the console
//   - maximizeEnergy, should update the energyLevel to 1000
//   - gainPower, should take an argument of a number and INCREASE the powerLevel by that number

// - Create 2 instances of your SuperHero class

// Reflection
// What parts were most difficult about this exerise?
```
Because I did this several days after other prework, specifically the objects and methods practice, I forgot when I could use `this.state`. 
I wanted to use it in an object literal and remembered we practiced using state within a class. Also I was struggling with creating static attributes. I was forgetting that I still set these to this.(key) = value even if that value is static.
```

// What parts felt most comfortable to you?
```
Because our prework involved so much repetition, a lot felt familiar, which feels really good! I am grateful for the practice we had to do! I had an easier time remembering syntax than I thought.
```
// What skills do you need to continue to practice before starting Mod 1?

```
I think I need to actively use each section's skills weekly for the next couple of months before my cohort starts in May so I do not forget any of the concepts!
I will be revisiting functions, objects, classes, array, variables...all of it!
```
