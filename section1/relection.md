## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

* Unfortunately the article was not available. However, I have been reading about learning strategies recently preparing for Turing. I have learned a lot about focused and defuse modes of thinking, where you spend time in focused attention and then take a break or sleep on it to step away from the problem and material and let your brain make connections. It is very interesting and because of it, I have been more intentional about breaks to capitalize on this. I have also learned about the importance of chunking material. There are a few tricks/tips that I have tried or would like to try. For example, I learned that when learning new material, especially when it is difficult that you should revisit it/practice within a day. One way to do this is to rewrite or rework notes the night of a lecture. I have not tried this yet, but plan to!

* I found in an article that sounded similar to the SuperLearner article we were meant to read that states that physically taking care of our brains is important. I would like to exercise during my pom breaks. I am actually really looking forward to using my log break for a walk for for some yoga. I think this would be helpful. I would also like to try to teach others what I learn even if I am just talking to an imaginary person (rubber duckying?) because this was also suggested as a way to really internalize and deeply understand what you are learning.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

* I learned about numeric (integer and floating-point numbers), boolean, string, array, and object data types. (Some of these might have come from Mod 0 as well.)
  * I learned that a _number_ data type includes all numbers including decimals and integers. Floating point numbers include decimals.
  * Large numbers *do not* use commas, ie `45600`
  * Examples of the numeric data type: `47`, `-3`, `16.25`
* I learned that a _string_ data type includes letters and other characters.
  * It can include any kind of text as long as it is wrapped in single or double quotes.
  * Example: `"✈️ I can't wait to travel home again after this pandemic!"`
* I learned that _Boolean_ data types evaluate to either `true` or `false`.
  * Booleans are helpful in telling the browser or application which script should run.
  * Examples of boolean data types: `isHungry = true` `3 === 6` would evaluate to false (would give us a boolean data type of false)
* An _array_ data type is a data type that includes a group or list of data.
  * You can think of an array like a container or collection.
  * Usually in an array, the elements are all of the same data type.
  * It is helpful in programming in that arrays can be easily sorted or searched.
  * Example: `var puppies = ["Jackson", "Pilot", "Gus"]`
* An _object_ data type is a collection of _key-value pairs._
  * Objects can point to data of any data type.
  * It is used to represent a collection of properties.
  * Example: `var person = {name: Stephanie, age: 32, favColor: blue}`


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

`console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?


```

//

/* "Insert code here"
*/
```

The purpose of code comments are to provide an explanation or annotation directly in your code to explain what the code is doing to communicate either with yourself or other programmers. It helps you to write notes that are ignored by the computer when running the script.



5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

* A variable is where data is stored for the program or computer to retrieve. It is often changed or manipulated.
* I would explain it to a 5 year old this way ...
 * "a variable is like a box. We are going to put stuff in that box, such as a certain kind of toy. We want to write a name on it so that later we can find our
 stuff easily. We also want to be able to add and remove things to that box, however we are going to add just one the kind of toy in that box that matches the name
 on the box, because we can have many different boxes for different kinds of toys. We can have one box for barbies, one for legos, and one for your art set. Then
 when you get older and you want a new art set we can put a whole new art set in that box, but it has to be an art set. You can't put your barbies in there."

```var barbieDolls = ["Ken", "Skipper", "Skipper2"];
var legos = [ "starWarsFalconSet" , "legoTreeHouse", "miscLostPiece1", "LegoColosseum"]
var artSet = "crayolaArt"
```

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Google
```
`var search = "Data types JS"` (string)
`var didClearSearch = true` (boolean)
`var isLoggedIn = true` (boolean)
`var resultsFound = 100,000` (number)
`var searchResults = ["url1.com", "url2.com", "url3.com"]` (array)
```

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

* Concatenation is when you combine variables and substrings to create a string by using a "+" to join them together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

* Youtube: I believe they use concatenation to display the details of videos to combine the data in a readable string. For example when they create a string that lists the views and the date viewed or number of subscribers.
```
`var videoDetail = numSubcribers + " subscribers" + numViews + " views -Premiered " + datePremiered `
```


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

         I don't have questions right now. Thank you! ☻
